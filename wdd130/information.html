                    Did you know that the average air a person breathes is 78% Nitrogen and only 21% oxygen? 
                    Oxygen is the reason we breathe, and our body has to work harder to filter the excess and provide our lungs with clean air.
                    Pure oxygen can help put your body at ease, clear your mind to help you think, and can even relieve stress. 
                    For those who struggle to breathe, this will be the best addition to your home!

                    Have you ever walked outside and the sky is just grey, but it isn't because of rain? 
                    This happens because of pollution, and if the air quality index for pollution is above 50, 
                    it is incredibly unhealthy to even be outside! This happens often for big cities like Los Angeles and others.
                    That is why our product is essential for those that live in the city. 
                    If you want to clear your lungs when the very air around you is working against you, you need O'hare Air!

                    Do you feel like you're out of breath too early when doing strenuous activity? Or you run out of breath and 
                    can't seem to catch it? This is a sign that you need oxygen but just aren't able to get it fast enough. 
                    Having air will help with that too! Whether running at sea level on the beach or hiking in the mountains, your body will need oxygen. 
                    And there's no better way to get it than breathing it pure.
