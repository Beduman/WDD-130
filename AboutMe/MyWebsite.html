        Hi! My name is Brady. I'm doing this class to learn programming and eventually be a software developer.
        I think computers are awesome! And building them and fixing them is one of the things I like to do.
        I actually saved up all my money as a kid for 2 years to build a computer. I do lack when it comes to 
        programming, however, which is why I'm happy I'm here! I'm also a big nerd, love Board Games, video games,
        and basically anything that has a story. Stories about fantasy are just so cool! Especially Lord of The Rings.

        I recently got married to the love of my life, and we're hoping to be up in Idaho for the next semester of school.
        Together we watch anime, play minecraft, and deal with the challenges of life. It's honestly so fun!
        I'm currently working as IT Support, setting up computers and users for a few different small companies.
        It teaches me alot, especially when I get crazy problems that come up. But most of the times, I just deal 
        with minor problems that have simple solutions. Helping others with computers is my life right now though,
        and I know my parents have really appreciated it. I enjoy helping my family with computer problems.

        Well I'm pretty excited, and very nervous about this class. I'm also taking an introduction to Python class
        while taking this and I hope the different programming languages don't get mixed up in my head. That being
        said, I'm ready to learn!
